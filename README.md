# cycplusSync
Pulls fit files ogg your cycplus M1 bicycle computer


This is largely based off of Kaiserdragon2 CycSync android app ( https://github.com/Kaiserdragon2/CycSync), only re-purposed to download the FIT files directly to your computer. From here you can do what you wish with them, includding upload them to strava. I personally view them locally with Fit File Viewer: https://github.com/Nick2bad4u/FitFileViewer
